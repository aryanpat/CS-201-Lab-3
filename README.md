# CS-201-Lab-3
In Lab 3, I used calendar and user input imports. With these imports I created 3 diverse clock type codes.

# What I Learned
With this lab I was able to finally intergrate User Input into my code and use the input for my projects problems. I was also able to use the calender and format imports and learned how to make a calendar in Java.
